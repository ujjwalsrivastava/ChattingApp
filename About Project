- Developed using java swing & Socket programming.
- Java Swing  is a part of Java Foundation Classes (JFC) that is 
used to create window-based applications.
- Java Swing is a lightweight Java graphical user interface (GUI) widget 
toolkit that includes a rich set of widgets.
-Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate 
with each other.
-A socket connection means the two machines have information about each other's 
network location (IP Address) and TCP port.
-Transmission Control Protocol is a unique identifier used with an IP address.
- Using awt package for color in frame.
-JPanel is a frame , on the top.
-ActionListener comes from awt package in java.
-We are using Mouse Listener for implementing back click feature, when 
user will click on back image sign , then app will end.
- using JLabel , you can write on the frame.
- setBounds function we are using to resizing.(from left,from above,khud ki length, aur breadth)
- We can use JTextField to create a textfield.
- We can use JButton to create a button.
- For using socket we generally use net package.
- DataInputStream comes under IO Package , used to read the input message
- DataOutputStream used to send the message.
- With the socket we connect to server url.
- readutf & writeutf function of socket programming we have used.
- message read- with the help of datainputstream , we call readutf & read the msg.
- message send - with the help of dataoutputstream , we call writeutf & send the msg.
